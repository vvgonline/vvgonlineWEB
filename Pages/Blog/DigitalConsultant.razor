        As a DBC and we often get asked how we make digital transformations happen. We tell
        them:
    </div>
    <blockquote class="py-5">
        <b>
            "When in a business a DBC get an opportunity to always question what we do, there is a question of why we
            do
            what we do, also a description of what we used to do".

        trust me and my team and thinks we are smart and capable of changing and improving their business processes for
