        @* As a digital business consultant in every client meeting, they always ask me how I create digital
        transformations And the answer is "When in a business I get an opportunity to always question what we do, there
        is a question of why we do what we do, also a description of what we used to do". These questions create a shift
        that results in an optimistic POV, and then the client starts to believe in me and my team; and considers this
        collective to be smart and this will change, and improve business processes creating the desired outcome.*@
        As a digital business consultant and we often get asked how we make digital transformations happen. We tell
        them:
        <blockquote class="blockquote py-2">
            <b>
                "When in a business we get an opportunity to always question what we do, there is a question of why we do

            </b>
        </blockquote>
        These questions spark a change in perspective that leads to a positive outlook. Then the client starts to
        trust me and my team and thinks we are smart and capable of changing and improving their business processes for
        the better.
