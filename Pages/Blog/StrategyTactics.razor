        <div>
            <p>
                Example <i>Genghis Khan</i> creator of one of the biggest Empire in <b>EuroAsia</b>. Let's now explore his
                Strategy and Tactics:
                <ul class="h5 py-4">
                    <li>
                        <b>Intelligence gathering strategy</b> was very effective by developing scouting teams, that
                        provided valuable intelligence which lead to capturing a fort.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Mobility and speed strategy</b> was implemented by horse Rider teams and thus it created a
                        communication network also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_(route)" target="_blank"
                                                               title="communication network YAM">"Yam"</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Siege Warfare strategy</b> was implemented by encircling and isolating enemy's supplier lines and
                        defeating
                        the fortified enemies by siege tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Psychological Warfare strategy</b> was very effective by creating fear spreading propaganda like
                        Genghis
                        Khan is Invincible and power of his armies that has been undefeated in battle which caused mass
                        confusion and
                        hesitation among his enemies.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>"YAM"</strong> tactics or communication network team methodology was being used in both strategy
                of
                speed
                and mobility as well as intelligence gathering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's see the effect of strategy and tactics in business: to develop new clients a tactics can be
                cold
                calling .Now, to make strategy even bigger consider reputation that is how business is perceived by
                people external to your company and curating on approach that reaches multiple target audience with the
                same narrative.

                <strong>
                    Why are both strategy & tactics important?
                </strong>
                <br><br>
                One can run a business by tactics alone but cannot run an effective business without strategy under
                pinning a tactics. Yes, it will definitely take more time but developing a strategy will give business a
                360 degree prospective understanding of all the teams and use them accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most isolated tactics stand the same chance of working which is almost none that is tactics without
                strategy have no driving force and nothing to pivot on if tactics is not working. Thus, a strategy is
                almost solid and does not change so often but a tactics can differ according to situations.
