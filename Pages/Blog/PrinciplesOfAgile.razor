        These 12 principles of agile are not rules or prescriptions, but a mindset and a culture that can help teams
        deliver software that is valuable, usable, and adaptable. They are not specific to any framework or
        methodology, but can be applied to any context or domain. They are not static or fixed, but dynamic and
        evolving, as the agile community and the software industry continue to learn and innovate.
