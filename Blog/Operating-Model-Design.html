                        This image presents a framework for thinking about <b>operating model design holistically</b>,
                        emphasizing that decisions related to organizational structure and processes are critical and
                        directly impact value delivery. It breaks down the operating model into three key pillars:
                        <b>Structure, Process, and People</b>.
                        <br>
                        Let's delve into each pillar in detail:

                    <h2>Overarching Message</h2>
                    <p>The central message at the top, "Think about the operating model holistically, as many decisions
                        related to structure and processes will be critical and link to value delivery," underscores the
                        interconnectedness of these elements. It suggests that an effective operating model isn't just
                        about how the organization is set up (structure) or how work gets done (process), but also about
                        the people who execute that work. All these aspects must be considered together to achieve
                        desired outcomes and deliver value.

                    <h2>Operating Model Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is the overarching theme, indicating that the following sections are components that need
                        to be intentionally designed and aligned.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span class="fs-4"><b>Pillar: Structure</b></span>
                            <p>This pillar focuses on how the organization is organized and its fundamental building
                                blocks. It includes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>"Boxes and lines" (primary and secondary axes of organization and structure):</b>
                                    This refers to the traditional organizational chart, outlining the different
                                    departments, divisions, and reporting relationships. It defines the formal hierarchy
                                    and how different parts of the organization are connected. This includes both the
                                    primary way the organization is segmented (e.g., by product, geography, function)
                                    and any secondary structures (e.g., matrix structures).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>
                                        Roles and responsibilities (e.g., profit-and-loss ownership, corporate-function
                                        role, sales team structure):
                                    </b>
                                    This defines the specific duties, accountabilities, and authority assigned to
                                    individuals and teams within the structure. It clarifies who is responsible for
                                    what, including key aspects like profit and loss ownership and the specific
                                    organization of functional teams (like sales).
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        Governance (e.g., decision rights, committee structure):
                                    </b>
                                    This outlines how decisions are made within the organization. It defines who has the
                                    authority to make specific decisions, the processes for decision-making, and the
                                    role of committees and other governing bodies.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        Boundaries and location (e.g., global footprint):
                                    </b>
                                    This considers the physical and geographical scope of the organization. It includes
                                    decisions about where different parts of the organization are located (globally or
                                    regionally) and the boundaries between different organizational units or with
                                    external partners.
                                </li>

                                In essence, the "Structure" pillar answers the question: "How is the organization
                                formally set up and who is responsible for what, and where?"
                            </span>

                                This pillar focuses on how work flows and how tasks are executed within the
                                organization. It includes:

                                    <b>Process design (cross-cutting process redesign):</b> This involves defining,
                                    documenting, and optimizing the key processes that span across different parts of
                                    the organization (cross-functional processes). This could include processes like
                                    order fulfilment, product development, or customer onboarding. Redesigning these
                                    processes aims for efficiency, effectiveness, and better customer outcomes.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Linkages (formal mechanisms to link corporate functions and business units):</b>
                                    This refers to the established and documented ways in which different parts of the
                                    organization (like corporate functions like HR or Finance and the various business
                                    units) interact and collaborate. These linkages can be through formal meetings,
                                    reporting structures, shared systems, or defined workflows.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Performance management (e.g., metrics and targets by which performance is
                                        measured):</b> This defines how the organization measures its success and the
                                    performance of its various parts and individuals. It includes establishing key
                                    performance indicators (KPIs), setting targets, and tracking progress against those

                                    <b>Systems and technology (e.g., end-state architecture):</b> This encompasses the
                                    IT systems, tools, and technology infrastructure that support the organization's
                                    processes. It also considers the desired future state of the technology architecture
                                    to enable efficient and effective operations.

                            <p>In essence, the "Process" pillar answers the question: "How does work actually get done
                                across the organization, how do different parts connect, how is performance measured,
                                and what technology supports these activities?"</p>

                            <p>
                                This pillar focuses on the human element of the operating model, recognizing that people
                                are crucial for executing the structure and processes. It includes:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                    <b>Workforce size (e.g., synergies in roles in corporate functions, sales, and
                                        non-sales):</b> This considers the number of people needed in different parts of
                                    the organization to effectively execute the work. It also looks for opportunities to
                                    create synergies and efficiencies in roles across different functions.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Talent and skills (e.g., retaining and selecting talent, addressing talent
                                        gaps):</b> This focuses on having the right people with the necessary skills and
                                    competencies in the right roles. It includes strategies for attracting, recruiting,
                                    developing, and retaining talent, as well as identifying and addressing any gaps in
                                    skills.
                                </li>

                                    <b>Culture (e.g., working norms, values, management practices):</b> This refers to
                                    the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and norms that influence how people work
                                    together within the organization. It also includes management styles and practices
                                    that shape the employee experience and organizational effectiveness.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Informal networks (e.g., influencers supporting change management):</b> This
                                    acknowledges the existence and importance of informal relationships and
                                    communication channels within the organization. Identifying and leveraging
                                    influential individuals within these networks can be crucial for driving change and
                                    adoption of new ways of working.
                                </li>

                            <p>In essence, the "People" pillar answers the question: "Who are the people doing the work,
                                what are their skills, what is the culture like, and how do formal and informal networks
                                influence operations?"</p>

                    <h2>The Holistic View</h2>
                    <p>The framework emphasizes that these three pillars are not independent but rather interconnected
                        and interdependent. Decisions made in one area will inevitably impact the others. For example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A change in the <b>structure</b> (e.g., creating a new department) will require defining new
                            <b>roles and responsibilities</b>, potentially impacting existing <b>processes</b>, and
                            necessitating the hiring or retraining of <b>people</b> with specific <b>skills</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>Redesigning a key <b>process</b> might require changes to the <b>structure</b> to ensure the
                            right teams are involved, necessitate new <b>systems and technology</b>, and demand that
                            <b>people</b> adopt new <b>working norms</b> and develop new <b>skills</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>A shift in organizational <b>culture</b> can influence how effectively <b>structures</b> and
                            <b>processes</b> are implemented and how engaged and productive <b>people</b> are.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Therefore, when designing or redesigning an operating model, leaders need to consider all three
                        pillars in an integrated way to ensure alignment and maximize value delivery. Neglecting any one
                        pillar can lead to inefficiencies, lack of clarity, and ultimately, hinder the organization's
                        ability to achieve its goals.</p>
